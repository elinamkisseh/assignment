        <h3>FOOTBALL</h3>
        <P>Football is a general term used to refer to many sports which use the foot and hands to score goals. Some
            countries have their ways they call it, especially the using of the foot. Some countries like Ghana,
            Nigeria,
            Afghanistan, Algeria, Albania, Andora, Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Armenia, Aruba, Bangladesh,
            Barbados call it football whilst US, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, Australia, Japan, South Africa, Southpart
            of
            Phillipians and Papua New Guinea. </P>
        <p>Football is the world's most popular ball game in number of participants and spectators. A sport similar to
            football(soccer) was played 3000 years ago in Japan. Chinese text from 50BC mentions football-like games
            between
            teams from China and Japan. Ancient Greeks and Romans also played a similar game to football-although
            Ancient
            Greek permitted the carrying of the ball. The English then had a misconception of football as some sought of
            chance for the "evil spirits" to mingle with mortals because of the cheering and the chanting of their
            favourite
            teams name was heard as noise which God forbid, a law was also made to stop such games on behalf of King
            Edward.
            Also it made alot of male youth fantasied in participating in football instead of joining the military.
            After
            sometime the ban was released off it though the noises were still existing. </p>
        <p> Later football became a local to national then eventually to international game to the extent of football
            being one of the
            main games that bring people together.Before we talk about how football is played here are the ten known
            contries for top football playing.

        <h3> HOW IS IT PLAYED</h3>
        Football is a team game played on a rectangular field. The objective of the game is to get the oval shaped
        football
        down the field either by kicking it or by passing it. The main idea of the the game is to get the ball into your
        opponents end zone or scoring zone.
        To play soccer, first, you'll need two teams. The goal of the game is to score more points than the other team
        by kicking the ball into their net. In the official rules, each team has 11 players and the game lasts for 90
        minutes. If it goes out of play across an end line, it's returned to play by the goalie kicking it (if the
        offensive team played it out) or by a corner kick by the attacking team (if the defenders played it out).
        <p>The object of the game of soccer, also known in some countries as football, is to drive a soccer ball into
            the opposing team's goal in order to score a point. The team that scores the most points by the end of a
            soccer match wins; if there is a tie score either the game goes into extra time or the official declares a
            draw.</p>
        <p>Soccer (Football) Soccer is played on a large grass field with a goal at each end. The object of the game is
            to get the soccer ball into the opposing team's goal. The key to soccer is that, with the exception of the
            goalie, players cannot touch the ball with their hands, they can only kick, knee, or head the ball to
            advance it or score a goal.</p>
        <p>To enjoy the game whilst watching it, people form small groups known as cheerleaders to give praises to their
            desired team. Some stadiums allow bringing of food in but drinks or beverages in glass bottles are not
            allowed.also do not forget, before you are permitted to enter the stadium there is a random search that is
            done before you are allowed to enter.</p>
