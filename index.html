            <h3>FOOTBALL(SOCCER)</h3>
            <P>Football is a general term used to refer to many sports which use the foot and hands to score goals. Some
                countries have their ways they call it, especially the using of the foot. Some countries like Ghana,
                Nigeria,
                Afghanistan, Algeria, Albania, Andora, Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Armenia, Aruba, Bangladesh,
                Barbados call it football whilst US, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, Australia, Japan, South Africa, Southpart
                of
                Phillipians and Papua New Guinea call it soccer. </P>
            <p>Football is the world's most popular ball game with a number of participants and spectators. A sport similar
                to
                football(soccer) was played 3000 years ago in Japan. Chinese text from 50BC mentions football-like games
                between
                teams from China and Japan. Ancient Greeks and Romans also played a similar game to football-although
                Ancient
                Greek permitted the carrying of the ball. The English then had a misconception of football as some sought of
                chance for the "evil spirits" to mingle with mortals because the cheering and the chanting of their
                favourite
                teams name was heard as noise which God forbid, a law was also made to stop such games on behalf of King
                Edward.
                Also it made alot of male youth fantasize in participating in football instead of joining the military.
                After
                sometime the ban was released off it though the noises were still existing. </p>
            <p> Later football became a local to national then eventually to international game to the extent of football
                being one of the
                main games that bring people together.Before we talk about how football is played, here are the ten known
                contries for top football playing:

            <h3> HOW IS IT PLAYED?</h3>
            Football is a team game played on a rectangular field. The objective of the game is to get the oval shaped
            football
            down the field either by kicking it or by passing it. The main idea of the the game is to get the ball into your
            opponents end zone or scoring zone.
            To play soccer, first, you'll need two teams. The goal of the game is to score more points than the other team
            by kicking the ball into their net. In the official rules, each team has 11 players and the game lasts for 90
            minutes. If it goes out of play across an end line, it's returned to play by the goalie kicking it (if the
            offensive team played it out) or by a corner kick by the attacking team (if the defenders played it out).
            <p> The team that scores the most points by the end of a
                soccer match wins; if there is a tie score either the game goes into extra time or the official declares a
                draw.</p>
            <p>Soccer (Football) Soccer is played on a large grass field with a goal at each end. The object of the game is
                to get the soccer ball into the opposing team's goal. The key to soccer is that, with the exception of the
                goalie, players cannot touch the ball with their hands, they can only kick, knee, or head the ball to
                advance it or score a goal.</p>
            <p>To enjoy the game whilst watching it, people form small groups known as cheerleaders to give praises to their
                desired team. Some stadiums allow bringing of food in but drinks or beverages in glass bottles are not
                allowed.Also do not forget, before you are permitted to enter the stadium there is a random search that is
                done before you are allowed in.</p>

                These deals sometimes have continued even after the player’s retirement, as seen in the LeBron James and
                Michael Jordan’s shoe deal with Nike. One of the top teams is known as the great BOSTON CELTICS and not

            <h4>FOOTBALL</h4>
            <P>Football is one sporting activities that most males in their youthful ages admire.Rugby football was thought
                to have been started about 1845 at Rugby School in Rugby, Warwickshire, England although forms of football
                in which the ball was carried and tossed date to medieval times (see medieval football ).The truth is
                football existed before there was such a thing as association football, rugby football or American football.
                None were first because each of those sports came into being with the adoption of uniform rules interpreting
                how a group played football.Many believe that rugby was born in 1823 when William Webb Ellis "with fine
                disregard for the rules of football (note that football was yet to split into the various codes) as played
                in his time at Rugby school, first took the ball in his arms and ran with it, thus originating the
                distinctive feature of the Rugby game".
                Although this is in fact apocryphal, since there is little in the way of evidence to substantiate this view,
                it is however the popular view. So through this the international committee named the Rugby world cup the
                "William Webb Ellis Trophy".</P>
        </div>
    
        <div class="cards">
            <h4> HOW IS IT PLAYED?</h4>
        </div>
        <p>One of the two codes of rugby football, it is based on running with the ball in hand. In its most common form, a
            game is played between two teams of 15 players each, using an oval-shaped ball on a rectangular field called a
            pitch. The field has H-shaped goalposts at both ends.. Players need to be aerobically and anaerobically fit,
            fast, agile, mobile, powerful, and strong. However, it’s not enough to be well-conditioned, ruggers need to be
            skilled too. The most basic law of the game is that no player is allowed to throw the ball forward to a
            teammate. In rugby, passes have to be thrown sideways or backwards to a teammate while the other ways to move
            the ball towards the opposition’s goal line to score points is by kicking or running with the ball.</p>

            <h3>Well this is actually the last sport I would like to talk about and it is HOCKEY.</h3>
        </div>
        <P>The roots of hockey are buried deep in antiquity. Historical records show that a crude form of the game was
            played in Egypt 4,000 years ago and in Ethiopia around 1,000BC, whilst an ancient form of the game was also
            played in Iran in around 2,000BC.
            Various museums offer evidence that a form of the game was played by the Romans and Greeks as well as by the
            Aztecs several centuries before Columbus arrived in the New World.
            The modern game of hockey emerged in England in the mid-18th century and is largely attributed to the growth of
            public schools, such as Eton.
            The first Hockey Association was formed in the UK in 1876 and drew up the first formal set of rules. The
            original association survived for just six years but, in 1886, it was revived by nine founding member clubs.</P>
    
        <div class="national">
            <h3>HOW IS IT PLAYED?</h3>
        </div>
        <p>Okay, Hockey is one tricky game but if you pay close attenton to it, you would realize how fun it is.In Ice
            Hockey, the game is played on a point based scoring structure. The main objective of the skaters is to score
            goals to get points based on the goals made by the team. The team scoring highest number of points is declared
            winner of the game. Apart from goals the teams get points for an Assist but it is a complex game but fun.One of
            the hospitable and nice hockey stadium people like to go to is USB ARENA in New York.</p>
